1. How will you tackle the challenge above?
=>To tackle the challenge of reading a CSV file, evaluating formulas, and outputting results,  This is the  process:-

  File Reading: Use BufferedReader to read the CSV file line by line. This allows for efficient handling of potentially
   large files.

  Data Structure: Utilize a Map<String, Double> to store evaluated values of cells. This allows for quick lookups when
  evaluating formulas.

  Formula Parsing: Implement a method to identify and evaluate formulas. This method will parse the formula, replacing
  cell references with their corresponding values from the map.
  Output Writing: Use BufferedWriter to write the results to an output CSV file, ensuring the format matches the
  original input.

2. What type of errors you would you check for?
=>When developing this application, I would check for several types of errors, including:

  File Not Found: Ensure the specified input CSV file exists. If not, handle the FileNotFoundException.
  IOException: Handle any I/O issues that may arise during reading or writing files.
  Invalid CSV Format: Check for unexpected line formats or malformed CSV rows that could cause parsing errors.
  Invalid Numeric Conversion: Handle exceptions when trying to convert string values to doubles, such as
  NumberFormatException. Formula Evaluation Errors: Check for invalid formulas that could reference non-existent cells
  or contain syntax   errors.
3. How might a user break your code?
=>A user might break the code in several ways:

  Invalid File Path: Providing a path to a non-existent CSV file will result in a FileNotFoundException.
  Malformed CSV Content: If the CSV contains rows with inconsistent columns or unexpected characters, it could cause
  parsing errors.
  Invalid Formulas: Using malformed or circular formulas (e.g., =A1+B1 where B1 references A1) may lead to runtime
  exceptions or incorrect evaluations.
  Non-numeric Input: Entering non-numeric values in expected numeric fields could trigger NumberFormatException when
  attempting to parse.
